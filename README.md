# Raffle contract

This is the Raffle contract, a smart contract for managing a decentralized raffle on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- Secure and transparent: all raffle operations are recorded on the blockchain and can be verified by anyone.
- Fair: the winner is chosen randomly and transparently using a verifiable random function.
- Flexible: the contract allows for customization of the raffle parameters, such as the entrance fee and the time interval between raffles.

## Usage

To use the Raffle contract, you will need an Ethereum wallet and some Ether (ETH) to pay the entrance fee for the raffle.

1. First, deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a suitable Ethereum wallet or dApp.
2. Then, users can enter the raffle by sending a transaction to the contract with the required entrance fee.
3. Once the time interval has passed or the required number of entrants has been reached, the contract will use a verifiable random function to choose the winner randomly and transparently.
4. The winner can then claim their prize by sending a transaction to the contract.
